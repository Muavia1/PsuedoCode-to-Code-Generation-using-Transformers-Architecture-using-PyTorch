# PsuedoCode-to-Code-Generation-using-Transformers-Architecture-using-PyTorch

**PsuedoCode2Code** is a transformer-based deep learning model that translates human-readable pseudocode into programming code. This project aims to assist developers, students, and educators by providing a structured way to convert psuedo code to c++ code.

## Features
- Utilizes a transformer architecture for sequence-to-sequence translation.
- Supports tokenization and vocabulary building for both code and pseudocode.
- Implements positional encoding and attention mechanisms to enhance translation accuracy.
- Uses PyTorch for efficient model training and inference.

## Installation
Clone the repository and install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Pandas
- tqdm

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to submit issues or pull requests.
